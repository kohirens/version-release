  Will trigger when changes are merged into the main trunk. A new changelog will
  be generated and auto merged into the main trunk; then a release will be
  published for the main trunk branch in this example.

  There are some prerequisites, so please go to

  which provides details on how to setup the following:

    1. Allow CircleCI to write back to a Github repository on your behalf
       to make branches and pull-request, via SSH and API.
    2. Allow CircleCI to trigger workflows using the CircleCI API.

    * CIRCLE_TOKEN
    * GH_WRITE_TOKEN
