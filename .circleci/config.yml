orbs:
  # Chicken-Egg/Catch-22 scenario
  # So when the "test-pack" pipeline runs "dev-orb-version" will be "dev:alpha", the previous build.
  # Only after a successful run of "test-pack" does a new version of your orb exist with the latest features.
  # This means you cannot use new features in the integration test pipeline until afterward. Make the process as follows:
  # 1. Push out new features/breaking changes without updating the integration pipeline.
  # 2. Make sure the pipeline succeeds.
  # 3. Update your integration pipeline to test the new features/breaking changes.
  # Further: When the "integration-test_deploy" pipeline runs it will use the latest dev image set to the latest hash.
  # However, the whole CI config is compiled before building your latest dev orb (with its latest features). So any
  # calls to those features will throw errors and the pipeline will fail.
  vro: kohirens/version-release@<<pipeline.parameters.dev-orb-version>> # We are calling our orb before we build the latest dev version!

# Pipeline Parameters
## These parameters are used internally by orb-tools. Skip to the Jobs section.
parameters:
  run-integration-tests:
    description: An internal flag to prevent integration test from running before a development version has been created.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  dev-orb-version:
    description: >
      The development version of the orb to test.
      This value is automatically adjusted by the "trigger-integration-tests-workflow" job to correspond with the specific version created by the commit and should not be edited.
      A "dev:alpha" version must exist for the initial pipeline run.
    type: string
    default: "dev:alpha"
