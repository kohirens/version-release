  Commit changes to the changelog and merge into a remote branch using the process:

  1. Configure Git to allow a commit.
  2. Making a new branch.
  3. Detect and commit the changes to the CHANGELOG, if none, then exit.
  4. Pushing the branch back to remote GitHub.
  5. Use the GitHub CLI to make a PR.
  6. Then immediately merge the changes in the desired branch.

  We use a PR instead of a push in case the branch is protected from direct pushes.
